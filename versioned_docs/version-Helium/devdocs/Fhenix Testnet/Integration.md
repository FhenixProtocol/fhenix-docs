Are you a developer looking to integrate Fhenix into your project, or support Fhenix with your app? This section is for you!

## Things to Know

### APIs, RPCs and general compatibility

Fhenix is based on Arbitrum, with the Helium Testnet based on Arbitrum Nitro version 2.3.4 (ArbOS 20). This means that everything that is natively supported 
by Arbitrum Nitro is also supported by Fhenix (rpc calls, ABI, etc).

Please refer to the [Arbitrum documentation](https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/arbitrum-vs-ethereum/comparison-overview) for more information and specifics.

### EVM Compatibility

Fhenix is fully EVM compatible, up to and including the Cancun Upgrade. 
This means that any contract that runs on Ethereum should run on Fhenix as well. We support Solidity compiler 0.8.26.

### Public Endpoints

We have public endpoints available for the Helium Testnet, which can be used:

<table>
   <thead>
      <tr>
         <th width="222">Type</th>
         <th>API</th>
      </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
      <tr>
         <td>JSON-RPC</td>
         <td><a href="https://api.helium.fhenix.zone"><strong>https://api.helium.fhenix.zone</strong></a></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>Chain ID</td>
         <td>8008135</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>Websocket</td>
         <td>wss://api.helium.fhenix.zone:8548</td>
      </tr>
   </tbody>
</table>

If you require specialized endpoints, or higher rate limits than the default please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/FuVgxrvJMY) or [email](mailto://info@fhenix.io).
