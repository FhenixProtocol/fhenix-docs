Here you can find a list of changes between different versions of the Fhenix Testnet(s) as we evolve and grow.


### Helium - Latest Version

* Added `eaddress` as a native type that can be found in FHE.sol directly

* Performance has been greatly increased for all data types
* Performance has been greatly increased for select operations

* Refactored gas prices for FHE operations to better reflect the operational cost of the operation. See [Gas and Benchmarks](../../Writing%20Smart%20Contracts/Gas-and-Benchmarks.md) for more information.
* Blocks are now posted to the Sepolia Testnet with support for EIP-4844 blobs.
