## Dependencies

In this guide we'll be using standard tools such as `git`, `docker`, `nodejs`, your favorite package manager such as `npm`, `yarn` or `pnpm` for NodeJS and your favorite IDE/Text editor.
:::note
Although you can use all the aforementioned package managers we primarily use, support and generally recommend **pnpm**.

## Installation

### Start From a Template

First, let's clone our template project.
Go to our [hardhat template repository](https://github.com/fhenixprotocol/fhenix-hardhat-example) and click "use this template". Choose your new project name and set up a repository.

    <summary>Help, I can't find the button!</summary>
    <TabItem>![Use this template](/img/use-this-template.png)</TabItem>
</details>

Now clone your new repository, or open a cloud-based environment such as Github Workspaces.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
```

Change the directory into the repository and install the project dependencies


<Tabs groupId="package-managers">
    <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
        ```bash
        yarn install
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">
        ```bash
        pnpm install
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### I'm more of a Free Spirit

Alternative set up paths can be just cloning or forking the example repository, or starting from scratch using our [Fhenix hardhat plugin](../../Tools%20and%20Utilities/Fhenix-Hardhat-Plugin.md), [Gitpod environment](../../Setting%20Up%20Your%20Environment/Gitpod.mdx) or Github Workspaces

## Configuring and Starting Localfhenix
In order for us to locally deploy and test contracts we will need to run our own node, for this specific use-case we have a docker image named `localfhenix`.
For ease of use and a simple setup we have hardhat task `localfhenix:start` that downloads and runs the image in a container for you.

#### Set up your Mnemonic

Hardhat uses an `.env` with mnemonics to deploy and interact with contracts. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and set your mnemonics (you can use the default mnemonics if you just want to use LocalFhenix)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
This is the output of `cat .env`:
```bash
# obviously DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION OR ANYWHERE OR WHATEVER
# default wallet of localfhenix
export MNEMONIC="demand hotel mass rally sphere tiger measure sick spoon evoke fashion comfort"
export WALLET=""
```
#### Starting LocalFhenix.

Use the following command:

<Tabs groupId="package-managers">
    <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">
        ```bash
        npm run localfhenix:start
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
        ```bash
        yarn run hardhat localfhenix:start
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">
        ```bash
        pnpm run localfhenix:start
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
You should see input similar to the following:

```
> fhenix-hardhat-example@1.0.0 localfhenix:start
> hardhat localfhenix:start

Downloading docker image ghcr.io/fhenixprotocol/localfhenix:v0.2.3...
```

:::warning
In case of an error in this step make sure docker is running, and you have the necessary permissions to run docker commands.
:::

Wait about a minute for the image to finish downloading, after which you should see a success message:

```
Downloading docker image ghcr.io/fhenixprotocol/localfhenix:v0.2.3...
done!
Started LocalFhenix successfully at 127.0.0.1:42069
```

We now have a Fhenix blockchain environment running locally! Everything is set up and ready, and we can move on to coding :)

:::tip
* If you want to make sure the container is running, you can use `docker ps` to see the container, available ports, etc.

* If you want to stop LocalFhenix you can issue the following command:
<Tabs groupId="package-managers">
    <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">
        ```bash
        npm run localfhenix:stop
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
        ```bash
        yarn run hardhat localfhenix:stop
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">
        ```bash
        pnpm run localfhenix:stop
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
