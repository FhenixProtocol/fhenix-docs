# ðŸŽ§ Remix

To get up and running with Remix, you should follow a few easy steps:

1. Add Fhenix to Metamask
2. Import `FHE.sol` from your contract
3. Optionally, use the Fhenix Remix Plugin to make your life a bit easier


## 1. Add Fhenix to Metamask

Follow the instructions in the [Fhenix Helium Testnet](../Fhenix%20Testnet/Connecting-To.md) to add Fhenix to Metamask.

## 2. Import FHE.sol

All you need is to include is the FHE.sol solidity library to your project so the compiler will know what to do.

```solidity
import "@fhenixprotocol/contracts/FHE.sol";
```

## 3. Fhenix Remix Plugin

The Fhenix Remix Plugin is a browser extension that adds Fhenix support to Remix. It allows you to encrypt and decrypt data in your contracts, and to interact with the Fhenix testnet.

See the [Fhenix Remix Plugin](../Tools%20and%20Utilities/Fhenix-Remix-Plugin.md) for more information on how to install and use the plugin!
