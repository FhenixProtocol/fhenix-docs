# Overview

There are a few different ways to set up an environment for development on Fhenix. All the tools you know from Solidity are mostly supported, though the addition of FHE means that a few custom tools are helpful. Here we'll describe the different ways you can set up your development environment.

The following environments are recommended for development on Fhenix:

- [Fhenix Hardhat Example](./Hardhat.md)
- [Fhenix with Remix](./Remix.md)
- [Gitpod Environment](./Gitpod.mdx)
- [Foundry](./Foundry.md)

:::note[Note]
The main developer tools are all based on Javascript & Solidity, but we have open bounties to add support for Python & Vyper!

If you just want to utilize one of the tools in your own environment, take a look at:

- [Fhenix-Remix-Plugin](../Tools%20and%20Utilities/Fhenix-Remix-Plugin.md)
- [Fhenix-Encryption-UI](../Tools%20and%20Utilities/Fhenix-Encryption-UI.md)
- [Hardhat-Plugin](../Tools%20and%20Utilities/Fhenix-Hardhat-Plugin.md)
