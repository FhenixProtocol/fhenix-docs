# ✨ Fhenix & FHE

Fhenix is revolutionizing the blockchain space by utilizing Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) for confidential smart contracts on public blockchains. An urgent blockchain challenge is ensuring privacy, and FHE is a promising solution. By leveraging FHE's ability to process encrypted data, privacy concerns are effectively addressed, thereby creating a safer environment for Web3 applications.

## FHE - Fully Homomorphic Encryption

FHE is a technology that enables processing data without decrypting it. With data encrypted both in transit and during processing, everything that is done online can now be encrypted end-to-end, not just digital messaging!

This means that companies can offer services, including operating on customer data, while ensuring customer privacy (since user data remains encrypted). Users can be confident that their data is private, and they experience no difference in functionality.

FHE makes it possible to write private smart contracts that keep on-chain data encrypted. You can create decentralized, permissionless blockchains with all data on-chain and auditable, while not actually visible.

## Fhenix Helium Testnet

The current Fhenix Helium Testnet is the first public iteration of the Fhenix protocol. It is still an early build, and it has bugs (unfortunately) and many features that are still under development.

There are many challenges ahead and many problems to solve. However, we are excited to be working on this project, because it is potentially an innovative and disrupting technology in the blockchain space.

What we write here is not set in stone. We are still considering the best way to move forward, and we are excited to have you here with us as we embark on this journey. Please let us know if you have any suggestions, ideas or comments. Feedback is always welcome. We are looking for ways to improve and for people to join us and contribute.
