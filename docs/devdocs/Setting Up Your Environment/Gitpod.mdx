If you're more of a cloud-based developer, you can skip all the installation steps and work directly with our Gitpod environment. This environment includes a LocalFhenix instance and all the tools you need to dive in.

## Usage

You can run an instance of LocalFhenix in Gitpod by [clicking here](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/fhenixprotocol/fhenix-hardhat-example).

After opening the Gitpod container and starting up the instance, you will be greeted with the following terminal:

![](/img/gitpod-ss1.png)

Please wait for about 60 seconds for the image to be downloaded and `localfhenix` to be started. Once the container is ready, you will see the following message:

![](/img/gitpod-ss2.png)

Now that we are ready, you can use the pre-configured contract to interact with the LocalFhenix instance. You can find the contract in the `contracts` folder.

## Deploy a contract

To deploy a contract, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat deploy
```

## Interact with a contract

### Send a transaction

To interact with our counter contract, you can use the predefined hardhat tasks:

```bash
npx hardhat task:addCount --amount 10
```

### View Functions

To view the current count, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat task:getCount
```

If everything was successful, you should see output similar to the following:

```bash
gitpod /workspace/fhenix-hardhat-example (master) $ npx hardhat task:getCount
Running getCount, targeting contract at: 0xbeb4eF1fcEa618C6ca38e3828B00f8D481EC2CC2
got count: 10
got unsealed result: 10
```
