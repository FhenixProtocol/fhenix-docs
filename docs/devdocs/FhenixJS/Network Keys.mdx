#### Network Encryption Key

Each Fhenix instance uses its own Encryption Key. This key is special, and allows users to encrypt their data in such a way that will match the encryption of all the other data on the network.

:::note[**Did You Know?**]
 The public key we refer to here is a _**global key**_ that is used to encrypt data being sent to the network. It is not the same as the _transactional public key_ that is used by fhenix.js to unseal data!
:::

If you're using fhenix.js you don't need to worry about this, as the public key fetching is already done automatically by the library.

##### Fetching the Public Key Manually

However, if you're using interfacing with Fhenix directly, you'll need to fetch the public key from the network you're connecting to. This can be done by calling the `getNetworkPublicKey` function on the network you're connecting to.

The Public Key is constant for the lifetime of the network, but still has to be fetched once by the user to be able to encrypt data. To do this, we use a special precompiled function that can be accessed programmatically in the following way:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ethers.js" label="ethers.js">
```javascript
const networkPkAbi = new Interface(["function getNetworkPublicKey()"])
let result = await provider.call({
  to: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000080",
  data: networkPkAbi.encodeFunctionData("getNetworkPublicKey");
});
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="web3.js" label="Web3.js">
```javascript
const networkPkSig = web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature("getNetworkPublicKey()");
let result = await web3.eth.call({
  to: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000080",
  data: networkPkSig
});
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cast (Foundry)" label="cast (Foundry)">
```shell
cast call 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000080 --rpc-url "https://api.nitrogen.fhenix.zone" "getNetworkPublicKey()"
```
