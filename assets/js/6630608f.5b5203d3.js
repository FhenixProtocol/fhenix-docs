The Threshold Network is currently initialized by a Trusted Dealer (in the future, we plan to eliminate the Trusted Dealer). The Trusted Dealer initially generates a key. Then, the Dealer uses Shamir's Secret Sharing cryptographic algorithm to generate Secret Shares of the key to share among individual members. Each member holds exactly one secret share. To perform a decryption, the secret shares are used to perform partial decryptions through a multiparty computation (MPC) protocol. These partial decryptions are then combined into the final plaintext. The protocol uses a T-out-f-N scheme, meaning that T parties out of a total of N existing parties need to agree and work together to perform a decryption. The benefit of this approach is that a single entity (Threshold Network \u201cmember\u201d) cannot decrypt the ciphertext, since it is necessary to have a consensus in order to decrypt, which provides the end user with additional protection from malicious actors."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.admonition,{title:"Note",type:"note",children:(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The Threshold Network in Nitrogen requires 3 out of 4 parties to decrypt ciphertexts."})}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"authentication",children:"Authentication"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"A Threshold Network authentication mechanism is important to differentiate between valid and invalid (or malicious) decryption requests.
